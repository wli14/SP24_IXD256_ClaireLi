# #Assignment #1.

#### To enhance students' time management during their morning makeup routine, I devised a system involving two pieces of copper tape affixed to the cover of a mirror. These pieces are wired to the M5 Atom board. When the two pieces of copper tape pieces make contact, the electrical circuit closes, signaling the input as "on"; otherwise, it remains "off". Once the digital input is "on", the Atom board initiates a process of drawing one pixel per second, gradually filling the display with nine pixels, representing nine seconds. Upon completion of the nine-second countdown, the display triggers visibility for a label indicating that time is up, prompting the user to finish up and prepare for school promptly to avoid tardiness.

# #Assignment #2.

#### To enhance children's enthusiasm for learning about color saturation and value, I've devised a wearable bracelet that integrates sensors such as the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and potentiometer (M5 ANGLE unit). Through this innovation, I translate the analog input values captured from the two sensors into computer graphics output, thereby providing an immersive, intuitive, and interactive experience. In the code, I established a mapping between color saturation levels ranging from 0 to 255 and the potentiometer values ranging from 0 to 4095. Additionally, I monitored X and Y tilt as well as X and Y motion using the IMU accelerometer. These values were then mapped from five distinct states to five corresponding color patterns on the computer output. As for the physical prototype, I utilized tie braids as a fabrication method and specifically used neoprene fabric, which is a rubber composition that offers waterproof properties, stretchiness, and excellent heat retention. This material is not only chemically stable but also remarkably flexible across a broad temperature spectrum. Its characteristics make it particularly suitable for children's use, ensuring durability and comfort during learning activities.
