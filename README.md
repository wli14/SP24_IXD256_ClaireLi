Assignment #1.

### To enhance students' time management during their morning makeup routine, I devised a system involving two pieces of copper tape affixed to the cover of a mirror. These pieces are wired to the M5 Atom board. When the two pieces of copper tape pieces make contact, the electrical circuit closes, signaling the input as "on"; otherwise, it remains "off". Once the digital input is "on", the Atom board initiates a process of drawing one pixel per second, gradually filling the display with nine pixels, representing nine seconds. Upon completion of the nine-second countdown, the display triggers visibility for a label indicating that time is up, prompting the user to finish up and prepare for school promptly to avoid tardiness.
